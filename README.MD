This repository contains my solutions for exercises in the book **Neural Network - A systematic approach** (Raul Rojas).

The solutions reside in 15 Interactive Python Notebook files, corresponding 15 sets of questions at the end of each chapter.

I have tried my best to implement all the answers in PyTorch.

Hope this work could help anyone who is a fan of neural network theory or an AI enthusiast, in general.
